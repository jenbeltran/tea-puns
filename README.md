# tea-puns

Tech Teahouse is a fully volunteer-run organization that is striving to build a diverse and inclusive Toronto tech communi-tea. 

This repo is for anyone that wants to contribute some tea puns to our social media.

If you do add something, please don't forget to add your social handles so we can give you credit!

Feel free to commit to the master branch directly, all ideas are welcome :)
